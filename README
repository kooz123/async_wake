**What is this?**

This is a custom UI, built by @LepidusDev to enable changing resolutions on any iOS 11 device. (Up to 11.1.2)

I've only tested on an iPhone 8, but have had successful reports on iPod 6, iPhone 8+, iPhone 7, and iPhone 6S.

To change resolution...

1) Open Xcode Project
2) Navigate to the `com.apple.iokit.IOMobileGraphicsFamily` file and change around the height and width.
3) Deploy to device
4) Launch on device
5) You will see a success message

Enjoy!
